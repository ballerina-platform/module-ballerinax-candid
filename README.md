[Candid](https://candid.org/) is a non-profit organization that provides a comprehensive database of information about nonprofits, foundations, grantmakers, and philanthropists. Their mission is to connect people who want to change the world to the resources they need to do it.

This Ballerina Candid connector is designed to interface with Candid.org's API, enabling developers to access Candid's resources programmatically. It supports various operations, such as searching for nonprofit organizations, accessing grant data, and retrieving information about philanthropic trends and insights.

Currently, the following Candid APIs are supported through this module

- **Charity Check PDF API**
  - The Charity Check PDF API is a powerful tool that allows to download formatted Charity Check PDF reports for individual nonprofits.
- **Essentials API**
  - The Essentials API is a lightweight API that provides basic information about nonprofits, such as their name, address, EIN, and mission statement. It is ideal for applications that need to quickly and easily identify and access basic nonprofit data.
- **Premier API**
  - The Premier API is a more comprehensive API that provides access to a wider range of nonprofit data, including financial information, staffing data, grantmaking data, and DEI data. It is ideal for applications that need to deep dive into the data of individual nonprofits or perform complex analyses of nonprofit data.

## Quickstart

To use the `Candid` connector in your Ballerina application, modify the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the connector

Import the relevent Candid module into your Ballerina project.

#### Charity Check PDF API
```ballerina
import ballerinax/candid.charitycheckpdf;
```

#### Essentials API
```ballerina
import ballerinax/candid.essentials;
```

#### Premier API
```ballerina
import ballerinax/candid.premier;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create an instance of `ApiKeysConfig` with the obtained Subscription Key and initialize the connector with it.

#### Charity Check PDF API
```ballerina
charitycheckpdf:ApiKeysConfig apiKeyConfig = {
    subscriptionKey: "ENTER-THE-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"
};
charitycheckpdf:Client charitycheckpdf = check new (apiKeyConfig);
```

#### Essentials API
```ballerina
essentials:ApiKeysConfig apiKeyConfig = {
    subscriptionKey: "ENTER-THE-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"
};
essentials:Client essentials = check new (apiKeyConfig);
```

#### Premier API
```ballerina
premier:ApiKeysConfig apiKeyConfig = {
    subscriptionKey: "ENTER-THE-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY"
};
premier:Client premier = check new (apiKeyConfig);
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

#### Charity Check PDF API
The following Ballerina program generates a PDF report to validate nonprofit status and eligibility with a 100% IRS-compliant charity check.

```ballerina
http:Response|error result = charitycheckpdf->/v1/pdf/["EMP-ID-NUM"];
```

#### Essentials API
The following Ballerina program finds nonprofits using search criterias and explore essential information.

```ballerina
essentials:V3Query query = {
    search_terms: "candid"
};
essentials:V3EssentialsResponse|error result = essentials->/v3.post(query);
```

#### Premier API
The following Ballerina program retrieves data on a nonprofit's financials, people, DEI, and IRS compliance validation for the given employer id number.

```ballerina
premier:V3PublicProfile|error result = check premier->/v3/["EMP-ID-NUM"];
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

```bash
bal run
```
